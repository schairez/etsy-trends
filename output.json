			"title": "Adult Reusable Mask With Filter Pocket-pink w/white square dot",
			"description": "For regular Adult size only. Measurements listed below.\n-Double layered cotton with filter pocket to create a total of 3 layer protection (does not come with a filter)\n-Masks come with the elastic cut and loose on ends so that you can tie to your desired comfort. You can snip off some of the excess elastic to make it look more appealing and then slide the knot through so that the fabric hides it. Some people have even tied the elastic together behind the head to relieve pressure from the ears. If you hate the elastic replace it with ribbon or shoe lace for example.\n-masks are sewn pleated to pull over your nose and chin.\n-All masks are made with different liner colors. You can order multiple of one fabric and you will be able to differentiate by the color of the liner\n-elastic color could be white or black, I cannot guarantee a certain color elastic.\n-More colors and patterns available in my shop.\n-This is an adult size mask. I have kids sizes also available in my shop.\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS:\nIt is best to hand wash in soapy hot water and let it soak for 10-15 min. Rinse and then lay out to dry. Hand washing will give your mask the most longevity.\nIf you do choose to put it in the washer and dryer make sure that the elastic ends are tied very tightly or pin them together so that elastic pieces don’t fall out or get lost. If the elastic falls out or gets lost use a safety pin to wiggle it through or a chop stick to push it through.\nWATCH MY YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR MORE INFO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zpx24LMzVM\n\nFILTER RECOMMENDATIONS:\nUse non woven items like a hepa filter fabric that filters .3microns, coffee filters, paper towel, tissues, swiffer duster etc.\n\nMEASUREMENTS OF MASK WHEN FOLDED LAYING FLAT:\nApprox 7 ½ inch x 3 ¼ inch\nEach elastic piece is approx 15.5 inches\n+++ For perspective model’s face measures 11 ½  inches from ear hole to ear hole and 3 ¼  inches from tip of nose to chin\n\n FOLLOW ME @angelinacoscuna_style\n\n+If you gotta wear a mask, make it fashion+",
