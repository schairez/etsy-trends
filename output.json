			"description": "Olson Face Mask design, with filter pocket and wire holder channel. Filters can be purchased separately at medical or workwear supply stores for extra protection. \n\nMade from a patterned cotton top layer, with a dense weave cotton under layer. There is a filter pocket on reverse and a slit to slide a wire through to give a better fit around the nose. For an even better seal the mask can be used with double sided tape or \u0026#39;Hollywood tape\u0026#39; across the nose or under the chin. \n\nThe mask has elastic sides to fit over your ears, the mask is designed to go right up to your ears, and elastics hold it in place comfortably. Please choose the best size for you and your face shape, due to the personal nature of this item, returns or exchanges are not possible. If you feel the ear elastics do not suit your face shape, simply cut and remove, and replace with ties or longer elastic and knot to suit. \n\nSmall: 13cms top to bottom across nose/mouth curve x 24cms across\n\nMedium: 14cms top to bottom across nose/mouth curve x 28cms across\n\nLarge: 15cms top to bottom across nose/mouth curve x 32cms across\n\nThis mask is not a replacement for N95 surgical masks. \n\nWASH BEFORE FIRST USE. Machine washable advisable on hottest setting with detergent. Line dry in sun (preferred) or tumble dry. Wash mask after every use. \n\nSuggestions for adjustable nose piece, if needed, are pipe cleaners - two or three twisted together make them stronger, or wire - thick wire is great, if you don\u0026#39;t have that, craft wire or florist wire twisted together will work. Thick durable plastic strips such as an ice cream container, cut thin 5mm strips from the curved corner of the container and slide into channel. \n\nMade with love from Handmade Card Store, in Australia. Stay safe everyone. For more information on how you can protect yourself and your loved ones please visit the Australian government website at www.health.gov.au",
